to save, load or render you need to enter a text (just by pressing key (a-z, 0-9 & '_')) in the menu
you cannot save if there is already a file with the same name
you cannot load if there is no file with this name
you can render img with the same name (it will just a _1 at the and until NAME_100.png exist)

your save files are save in 'data/'
your rendered imgs are save in 'img/'
you dont need to touch img in 'source/'

yeah i know, my code is not realy "Clean"
and i use some dark trick
but the program works so no problem

currently, the langage is english but you can copy and past what is in the 'lang/fr.py' in the 'current_langage.py'

run 'main.py' to use the program
you need pygame
run in the terminal: pip install pygame
